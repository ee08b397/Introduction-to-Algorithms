I'll pick the singly linked list as an example.

The singly linked list is probably the first dynamic data structure we learn in class.
Its strengths includes dynamic space allocation, easy insertion, easy deletion.
its weaknesses includes sequential accessing, coding complexity.

Of course, the comparison is made with array.
